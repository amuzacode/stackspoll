# 🌱 Stackspoll

**Stackspoll** is a decentralized platform that revolutionizes carbon offsetting by leveraging the security of Bitcoin via the **Stacks** blockchain. Using **Stacks** and Clarity smart contracts, Stackspoll tokenizes carbon credits, enabling transparent, verifiable, and trustless carbon credit issuance, trading, and retirement.

---

## 🌍 What is Stackspoll?

Stackspoll tackles the challenge of fragmented and opaque carbon credit systems by offering a blockchain-based solution that ensures:

- **Transparency** — Carbon credits are traceable from issuance to retirement.
- **Decentralization** — No central authority controls the platform.
- **Security** — Built on Bitcoin via Stacks, ensuring immutability and trustlessness.
- **Verifiability** — Each carbon credit is tokenized and can be audited on-chain.
- **Accessibility** — Open to individuals, companies, and institutions seeking to offset emissions.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Carbon Credit Tokenization**  
  Verified carbon credits are represented as Clarity-based tokens on the Stacks blockchain.

- **Decentralized Marketplace**  
  Users can buy, sell, and retire credits using smart contract-driven mechanisms.

- **Retirement Certificates**  
  Retiring a credit issues a proof-of-retirement NFT, permanently removing the credit from circulation.

- **Bitcoin-Level Security**  
  Built on Stacks, Stackspoll benefits from Bitcoin’s proof-of-work finality and network integrity.

- **Gaia and IPFS Integration**  
  Off-chain metadata and documents are stored securely and referenced immutably on-chain.

## 🔄 Carbon Credit Lifecycle

1. **Issuance**  
   Verified providers submit real-world carbon offset documentation.

2. **Tokenization**  
   Credits are minted as unique Clarity-based tokens, representing a fixed CO₂ offset value.

3. **Marketplace Listing**  
   Users can list, buy, and trade credits on a decentralized marketplace.

4. **Retirement**  
   Tokens can be retired (burned), producing an immutable on-chain retirement proof.

5. **Certification**  
   Retirees receive an NFT-based certificate containing metadata of the retired credit.

---

## 🔐 Security & Trust

- Clarity smart contracts are **non-Turing complete**, making them predictable and secure.
- All actions (minting, trading, retiring) are logged immutably on-chain.
- Audit-ready smart contract structure using community-reviewed standards.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap

- ✅ Tokenize carbon credits as Clarity NFTs
